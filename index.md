# About Me


Here is **Xin-Cheng Wen (ÊñáÊòïÊàê)**.

I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student specializing in Computer Science (CS) at STAR Lab, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Cuiyun Gao](https://cuiyungao.github.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree in the School of Informatics at Xiamen University in 2022, advised by Prof. [Kun-Hong Liu](https://cdmc.xmu.edu.cn/info/1010/1055.htm). My research pursuits primarily revolve around the captivating fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for software engineering.


If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *xiamenwxc[at]foxmail.com*
